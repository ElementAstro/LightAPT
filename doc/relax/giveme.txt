赐我一段代码
怎么你又匆匆变红
赐我一堆警告
怎么剩我那已修改
赐我一场期待
怎么彼此语言都不通
只道当初何必谈轻量
恍惚之间已是一个月过去
代码过万却还是冰山角
太多特性纠缠我却动他不得
修正了的却依然通不过
界面不知不觉增加了色彩
可那交互逻辑该怎么处理
我好像独自站在那，
万尺楼台，
等你来把我，
往下一脚踹！

赐我一段代码
怎么你又匆匆变红
赐我一堆警告
怎么剩我那已修改
赐我一场期待
怎么彼此语言都不通
只道当初何必谈轻量

我们若只如
第一次遇见
为你而轻量灵活
一切都不会变
已是屎山堆积又何须优化
徒留想着怎么慢

那些思路不甘白白被掩埋
偶尔思路想法偏偏又作怪
理不清 求不来 写不出 学不懂
是恨 是爱 还是意志坚定

赐我一段代码
怎么你又匆匆变红
赐我一堆警告
怎么剩我那已修改
赐我一场期待
怎么彼此语言都不通
只道当初何必谈轻量

原创与抄写没区别
何必又夜夜念独立
忘了你最初的目标
和你最后的无能
若你早知道会镜像
何必曾拨费劲思考
复制又粘贴是瞬间
完不成才是永远

Give me a piece of code
Why did you turn red again in a hurry
Give me a bunch of warnings
How can I leave my modified
Give me an expectation
Why don't you know each other's language
Just say why talk about light weight at the beginning
It has been a month since I was in a trance
The code is more than 10000, but it is still the tip of the iceberg
Too many characteristics pester me, but I can't touch him
Corrected but still failed
The interface adds color unconsciously
But what about the interaction logic
I seem to be standing there alone,
Ten thousand feet tower,
When you come and take me,
Kick down!
Give me a piece of code
Why did you turn red again in a hurry
Give me a bunch of warnings
How can I leave my modified
Give me an expectation
Why don't you know each other's language
Just say why talk about light weight at the beginning
If we just
First meeting
Lightweight and flexible for you
Nothing will change
It's a pile of shit. Why should we optimize it
Just keep thinking how slow
Those ideas are not willing to be buried in vain
Occasionally, my thoughts are biased and strange
If you can't understand, you can't write
Hate, love or determination
Give me a piece of code
Why did you turn red again in a hurry
Give me a bunch of warnings
How can I leave my modified
Give me an expectation
Why don't you know each other's language
Just say why talk about light weight at the beginning
There is no difference between original writing and copying
Why do you want to be independent every night
Forget your original goal
And your last incompetence
If you knew it would mirror
Why bother to think
Copy and paste is instantaneous
It is forever to fail
